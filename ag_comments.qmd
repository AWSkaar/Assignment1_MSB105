## General Comments

- Nice little paper and it's reproducible to several output formats
- I have suggested some minor changes to the text
- Nice that you picked Finance as a case
  - You could perhaps have used the paper by Harvey, Liu and Zhu (2016) as a starting point since Jens et. al is kind of a rebuke of their critic. But this paper seem to be behind a paywall.

## Fixes and tips

- Added `output-file: "msb105_ass_1_25_tex.pdf"` to pdf format in YAML. Else typst and pdf will overwrite each other. There is some minor differences in the pdf files generated by the two programs.
- Added `citeproc: true` to YAML. Forces `typst`to use `bibtex` instead of it's own citation system.
- la programvaren gj√∏re jobben sin, 
  - endret til `[@parashar2022; @turkyilmaz-vandervelden2020]` fra `([@parashar2022]; [@turkyilmaz-vandervelden2020])`
  - endret til `[@jasny2011; @peng2011]` fra `([@jasny2011];[@peng2011])`
