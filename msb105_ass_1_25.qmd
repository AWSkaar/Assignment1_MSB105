## Introduction

What is this paper about?
What is discussed?
Why is it of any consequence?

This paper is about reproducibility.
First, I will present literature related to reproducibility in order to define what it is.
In addition, I will present articles that discuss some of the challenges.
Then, the theory on replicability is presented and what researchers think about it.
Furthermore, the theory is discussed, based in findings, including whether reproducibility is asking too much.
Is it good enough, or should replicability become the new standard?
I will also discuss possible solutions to this.
Finally, I will give a conclusion.

## Literature review

Smart stuff from others about the topic.

Use a least 20 citations, a least 5 of them must be new (not from the provided .bib file).

Use both in-line and normal citations.

Example:

@brase2009 argues that bla bla bla.
On the other hand it's claimed that bla bla [@gentleman2004; @knuth1984].

### Reproducibility

Reproducibility refers to the ability to use data from a study and obtain the same results (@parashar2022).
This is an important topic in research and academia because it relates to the validity of a study.

Several articles address the problems of generating reproducible data.
Some of the reasons are that it can be difficult to use the same software, and raw data is not always available.
Solutions to these challenges have also been discussed.
One such solution is a principle called FAIR, which states that data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable ([@parashar2022];[@turkyilmaz-vandervelden2020]).
Additionally, archives have been created for data where researchers can upload data used in their studies.
Furthermore, there are requirements for data to be well-documented in order to be uploaded to these archives.

### Replicability

In addition to reproducibility, there is also replicability.
This involves replicating a previous study using different data.
It is regarded as the gold standard ([@jasny2011]).
At the same time, expectations about replicability are more nuanced.
If one does not obtain the same results as a previous study, there can be many factors at play ([@nationalacademiesofsciences2019]).

@nationalacademiesofsciences2019 mentions these factors: the discovery of an unknown effect, inherent variability in the system, inability to control complex variables, substandard research practices, and, quite simply, chance.

### Quarto document

"Quarto documents are fully reproducible and support dozens of output formats, like PDFs, Word files, presentations, and more" [@grolemund].

## Discussion of the research question

-   Should replicability be the norm or is this to much to ask for now?
-   Can Quarto documents help with reproducibility?
-   What problems remains and how can these be solved?

Let’s take an example.
A study aims to investigate whether richer people are happier than poorer people.
They survey a random sample of 1,000 individuals.
Let’s say that the study finds that richer people are indeed happier than poorer people.

Now, a new study is to research exactly the same issue.
If this study does not arrive at the same conclusion, can we trust the previous study?
On the other hand, it's challenging to use the exact same program with the same version that employs the same calculations.
Is there sufficient documentation for the first study?
Is it defined adequately how individuals define happiness?
How is it determined whether someone is rich or poor?
These are also factors that make it difficult to replicate the study.

This is a complex discussion, and there are several factors at play.
It is certainly an economic question and discovering that previous research is accurate may not yield as much credit.
At the same time, it is important that research can be trusted.
