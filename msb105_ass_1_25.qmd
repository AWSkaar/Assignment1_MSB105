## Introduction

What is this paper about?
What is discussed?
Why is it of any consequence?

This paper is about reproducibility.
First, it will resent literature related to reproducibility in order to define what it is.
In addition, it will present articles that discuss some of the challenges.
Then, the theory on replicability is presented and what researchers think about it.
Furthermore, the theory is discussed, based in findings, including whether reproducibility is asking too much.
Is it good enough, or should replicability become the new standard?
It will also discuss possible solutions to this.
Finally, it will give a conclusion.

## Literature review

Smart stuff from others about the topic.

Use a least 20 citations, a least 5 of them must be new (not from the provided .bib file).

Use both in-line and normal citations.

Example:

@brase2009 argues that bla bla bla.
On the other hand it's claimed that bla bla [@gentleman2004; @knuth1984].

### Reproducibility

Reproducibility refers to the ability to use data from a study and obtain the same results (@parashar2022).
This is an important topic in research and academia because it relates to the validity of a study.

The replication crisis, which is well-known in fields such as psychology and medicine, has recently started to garner increased attention in finance [@jensen2023].
This phenomenon refers to the alarming recognition that numerous financial studies and models, previously regarded as reliable, do not yield consistent results when their methods are applied to new datasets or evaluated under varying conditions.
Contributing factors to this problem include publication bias, p-hacking, and the selective reporting of results [@hasso2025].

Several articles address the problems of generating reproducible data.
Some of the reasons are that it can be difficult to use the same software, and raw data is not always available.
Solutions to these challenges have also been discussed.
One such solution is a principle called FAIR, which states that data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable ([@parashar2022];[@turkyilmaz-vandervelden2020]).
Additionally, archives have been created for data where researchers can upload data used in their studies.
Furthermore, there are requirements for data to be well-documented in order to be uploaded to these archives.

### Replicability

In addition to reproducibility, there is also replicability.
This involves replicating a previous study using different data.
It is regarded as the gold standard ([@jasny2011]).
At the same time, expectations about replicability are more nuanced.
If one does not obtain the same results as a previous study, there can be many factors at play ([@nationalacademiesofsciences2019]).

@nationalacademiesofsciences2019 mentions these factors: the discovery of an unknown effect, inherent variability in the system, inability to control complex variables, substandard research practices, and, quite simply, chance.

A team of researchers tried to replicate articles published i en Journal of Money, Credit and Banking.
They were only able to replicate 2 of 54 articles.
One thing they observed was that if the authors didnt organized their data and code before submitting their articles, there was little hope of reproducing the same results later ([@mccullough2008]).

### Quarto document

"Quarto documents are fully reproducible and support dozens of output formats, like PDFs, Word files, presentations, and more" [@grolemund].

Quarto documents are designed to be used in three different ways.
One is to communicating for decision-makers.
A second way is to collaborate with other scientists.
The last is that it works as an environment in which to do data science, as a lab notebook [@grolemund].

## Discussion of the research question

-   Should replicability be the norm or is this to much to ask for now?
-   Can Quarto documents help with reproducibility?
-   What problems remains and how can these be solved?

Reproducibility and replicability are essential concepts in research that significantly affect the validity of scientific findings.
Reproducibility involves obtaining the same results using the original study's data and methods, which is crucial for confirming the reliability of research outcomes.
In contrast, replicability refers to the ability to conduct a study anew with different data while seeking to verify previous findings.

Quarto documents can greatly assist with reproducibility due to their features, allowing users to view all the code and related content.
However, it is quite challenging to claim that Quarto documents are fully reproducible, as @grolemund says.

Such archives where researchers can upload their data represent an important step toward achieving reproducible documents.
However, research indicates that even when data has been uploaded, it is not always easy to reproduce or replicate the findings.

Let’s take an example.
A study aims to investigate whether richer people are happier than poorer people.
They survey a random sample of 1,000 individuals.
Let’s say that the study finds that richer people are indeed happier than poorer people.

Now, a new study is to research exactly the same issue.
If this study does not arrive at the same conclusion, can we trust the previous study?
On the other hand, it's challenging to use the exact same program with the same version that employs the same calculations.
Is there sufficient documentation for the first study?
Is it defined adequately how individuals define happiness?
How is it determined whether someone is rich or poor?
These are also factors that make it difficult to replicate the study.

This is a complex discussion, and there are several factors at play.
It is certainly an economic question and discovering that previous research is accurate may not yield as much credit.
At the same time, it is important that research can be trusted.
