## Introduction

What is this paper about?
What is discussed?
Why is it of any consequence?

This paper is about reproducibility.
First, I will present literature related to reproducibility in order to define what it is.
In addition, I will present articles that discuss some of the challenges.
Then, I will present theory on replicability and what researchers think about it.
Furthermore, I will discuss the theory I have found, including whether reproducibility is asking too much.
Is it good enough, or should replicability become the new standard?
I will also discuss possible solutions to this.
Finally, I will give a conclusion.

## Literature review

Smart stuff from others about the topic.

Use a least 20 citations, a least 5 of them must be new (not from the provided .bib file).

Use both in-line and normal citations.

Example:

@brase2009 argues that bla bla bla.
On the other hand it's claimed that bla bla [@gentleman2004; @knuth1984].

### Reproducibility

Reproducibility refers to the ability to use data from a study and obtain the same results (@parashar2022).
This is an important topic in research and academia because it relates to the validity of a study.

Several articles address the problems of generating reproducible data.
Some of the reasons are that it can be difficult to use the same software, and raw data is not always available.
Solutions to these challenges have also been discussed.
One such solution is a principle called FAIR, which states that data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable ([@parashar2022];[@turkyilmaz-vandervelden2020]).
Additionally, archives have been created for data where researchers can upload data used in their studies.
Furthermore, there are requirements for data to be well-documented in order to be uploaded to these archives.

### Replicability

In addition to reproducibility, there is also replicability.
This involves replicating a previous study using different data.
It is regarded as the gold standard ([@jasny2011]).
At the same time, expectations about replicability are more nuanced.
If one does not obtain the same results as a previous study, there can be many factors at play ([@nationalacademiesofsciences2019]).

@nationalacademiesofsciences2019 mentions these factors: the discovery of an unknown effect, inherent variability in the system, inability to control complex variables, substandard research practices, and, quite simply, chance.

### Quarto document

"Quarto documents are fully reproducible and support dozens of output formats, like PDFs, Word files, presentations, and more [@grolemund]."

## Discussion of the reseach question

-   Should replicability be the norm or is this to much to ask for now?
-   Can Quarto documents help with reproducibility?
-   What problems remains and how can these be solved?
